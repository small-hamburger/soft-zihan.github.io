## 🖼️ How to use Images (New!)

Sakura Notes v1.2 supports smart image path resolving.

### 1. Relative Path (Recommended)
Place the image next to your markdown file.
```markdown
![My Cat](./cat.png)
```

### 2. Assets Folder (Organized)
Place images in `notes/assets/` and reference them using `..`.
```markdown
![Logo](../assets/logo.png)
```

### 3. Sizing with HTML
You can now use HTML tags to control image size!
```html
<img src="./cat.png" width="300" style="border-radius: 20px;">
```

**Try clicking any image to see the new Lightbox feature!**
